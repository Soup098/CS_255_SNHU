Repo for System Analysis and Design Course

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  -Driverpass is an application that the client wanted to develop and use to create a platform for users to take online driving courses and practice tests, while also providing the ability to schedule time with in person drive instructors
  
What did you do particularly well?

  -I really enjoyed creating all of the UML diagrams. They really make it easy to visualize how the program will work and what methods and skills will be needed to impliment them. 
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  -For me it would be the class diagram. Up to this point I still have a difficult time coming up with creative solutions to what classes, methods, and data variables will be needed to complete the program, and execute in the class diagram.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  -Reading the interview transcript and then making a list of wants and needs through that. Implementing them in the different diagrams and gantt schedule as well.
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  -The code i currently write tents to be a "throw everything at the wall at once" type of approach, however i will definitely be using work from this class to build my skills up as a programmer in the future.
